# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
This study guide was created to get a basic understanding of skills to prepare for the UT Fullstack Coding Bootcamp. In buiding this study guide, I was introduced to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned that HTML is the basic layout of a webpage, CSS adds style, and JavaScript provides functionality. I now I have a depository of code that I used, and am able to reference back to in the future. I learned to solve problems or issues on my own, to follow directions carefully, and to be inquisitive on how and why certain code works, or does not.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
